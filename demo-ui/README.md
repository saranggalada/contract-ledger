# DEPA Training - Contract Signing Demo UI

A user-friendly web interface for demonstrating multi-party electronic contract signing for DEPA Training scenarios.

## Quick Start

From the project root directory, simply run:

```bash
./launch-demo.sh
```

Then open your browser to **http://localhost:5050**

## Features

### Scenario Selection
Choose from three pre-configured DEPA Training scenarios:
- **BraTS** - Brain tumor segmentation with 4 MRI dataset providers
- **COVID-19** - Healthcare data combining ICMR and CoWIN systems  
- **Credit Risk** - Multi-bank credit assessment collaboration

### Role-Based Workflow
The UI supports two roles that can be demonstrated:

#### Training Data Provider (TDP)
1. Setup contract template from scenario
2. Install CLI tools
3. Initialize contract service connection
4. Create DID (Decentralized Identifier) via GitHub Pages
5. Sign the contract
6. Register contract with the service
7. View receipt and validate

#### Training Data Consumer (TDC)  
1. Install CLI tools
2. Initialize contract service connection
3. Create DID via GitHub Pages
4. Retrieve contract using sequence number from TDP
5. Add signature to the contract
6. Register fully-signed contract

### Configuration
All environment variables can be configured through the UI:
- GitHub usernames for TDP and TDC
- Azure storage account and KeyVault settings
- Contract service URL
- CCRP (CCR Provider) username

### GitHub Integration
- DID creation automatically uploads to GitHub Pages
- Logout button for switching between GitHub accounts
- Verification links to check DID publication

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) - for DID creation
- `envsubst` (from gettext) - for template processing
- `jq` - for JSON processing

The launch script will attempt to install missing dependencies.

## Demo Flow

### Role-Playing Demo

For a full demonstration of multi-party contract signing:

1. **Start as TDP:**
   - Select a scenario (e.g., BraTS)
   - Select "TDP" role
   - Run all setup steps
   - Create DID (authenticate as TDP GitHub account)
   - Sign and register the contract
   - Note the **sequence number** displayed

2. **Switch to TDC:**
   - Click "Logout GitHub" 
   - Sign out in IDE (Ctrl+Shift+P → Sign out of GitHub)
   - Select "TDC" role
   - Enter the sequence number from TDP
   - Create DID (authenticate as TDC GitHub account)
   - Retrieve the contract
   - Sign and register the fully-signed contract

## API Endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### "DID not found" error
- Wait a few seconds after DID creation for GitHub Pages to deploy
- Verify the DID URL is accessible in a browser
- Check that the GitHub repository exists with the correct name

### GitHub authentication issues
- Run `gh auth logout` in terminal
- Sign out in your IDE
- Re-authenticate with the correct account

### Script execution errors
- Ensure the main project venv is set up: `./demo/contract/0-install-cli.sh`
- Check that all prerequisites are installed
